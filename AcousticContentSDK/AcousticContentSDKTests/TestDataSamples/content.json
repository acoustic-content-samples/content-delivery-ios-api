The fact that the places of Croatia were used as a setting for a play or as filming locations. As these stunning places attract not only writers and producers, we will share with you 3 most popular destinations for travelers. Dubrovnik Located about 50 km from Montenegro, Dubrovnik is the southernmost town in Croatia that was listed as UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1979. The best time to visit Dubrovnik is from April to mid-June, and mid-September to mid-October. The most visited place in Dubrovnik is the old town, available only to pedestrians and surrounded by ancient walls. The old part of Dubrovnik is very well saved and filled with astonishing Renaissance, Gothic, and Baroque buildings, churches, and monasteries. After visiting the old town, explore Dubrovnik museums, among which Ethnographic museum Rupe, Dominican Monastery, tower Gornji Ugao, and Red History Museum. To grasp the whole beauty of the old town and enjoy it from the bird's view, you are welcomed to take a cable car ride, and it will take you from downtown about 800 meters up to the mount Srd. Besides the historical old town tour, you can enjoy taking the 'Game of Thrones' tour, where you will be guided through the filming locations of popular TV series. Zagreb The capital of Croatia, Zagreb, is also the largest city in the country. It originally existed as two different city centers: Kaptol, where mainly clerics resided, and Gradec, inhabited mainly by farmers and traders. In 1851, the Ban of Croatia (noble title) merged two cities in one under the name of Zagreb with the main city square named after Josip Jelačić. The best time to visit Zagreb is in spring and early summer. In early to mid-August, the temperature can be quite high and many locals take their holidays at this time, therefore you may find some of the local merchants’ shops and bars closed in this period. Spending your vacation in Zagreb, make sure to: Explore the Upper town - the oldest part of Zagreb that houses its top attractions: the Lotrscak tower, Stone gate, St. Marc Church, Stross promenade, the Mestrovic Atelier, and the Klovicevi Dvori gallery; Visit Downtown, filled with countless shops,  bars, and restaurants, located on Jelacic Square, Tkalciceva Street, Bogoviceva Street, and Cvjetni Trg (Flower’s Square); Attend museum of Broken relationships, where all featured items are relics of broken relationships; Come to the Technical Museum. Its main floor is dedicated to transport with a display of old cars, trains, planes, trams, as well as models of different ships and boats; Hike in Medvednica Mountain, located north of Zagreb. The most popular hike is up to the Puntijarka mountain house, located at the elevation of 957 m. Hvar Hvar is perhaps the most famous of all Croatian islands. It is located in central Dalmatia and between islands of Brac, Vis, Korcula, and Peljesac peninsula. The island is over 68 km long from northwest to southeast and is the longest Croatian island. The main tourist season starts in late June and lasts to early September, peaking at the end of July till the middle of August. On the island, plan an unhurried vacation to admire its beauty, visit the Stari Grad Hvar (the Old Town), and, of course, taste local wines. Stari Grad Hvar is the oldest settlement on the island. The old town consists of traditional stone buildings, stone-paved roads, and countless churches. One of the most fascinating places in town is Tvrdalj Castle, a palace from the 16th century. Plan a full-day wine tour while on the island of Hvar. Popular wine-producers are Zlatan Otok, Tomić Wines, PZ Svirce, Plancic Brothers, and others. Popular wine grape varieties include red plavac mali and white pošip." ],

And if the nightlife is about the same in different cities across the globe, the nature of this country is what you have to come here for. Explore Kenya With a Remarkable Safari Kenya is considered the place where safari initially appeared. Vast magnificent national parks and conservancies are at your disposal to explore the wildlife of this country. It is one of the best places in Africa to see the \"Big Five\": lion, leopard, buffalo, elephant, and rhino. Perfect places for safari would be Masai Mara and Lake Nakuru.

Diving in Kenya is mostly fine throughout the year, although visibility decreases in July and August due to silting. The weather is almost always warm and sunny, with excellent water temperature, which creates ideal conditions for diving. Several first-class diving places that worth visiting include: Sites of the coast North of Mombasa, with the best ones in the Watamu Marine National Park; Dive site in the Canyon - a long sandy channel, bordered on each side by deep drop-offs; Sites at Mtwapa and Barracuda Reef, where you can see large shoals of angel and butterfly fish, and the world’s largest shark - the impressive Whale Shark. Climb Africa’s Second-highest Mountain Mount Kenya is the highest mountain in Kenya (5,199 m) and second-highest in Africa, after Kilimanjaro (5,895 m). The main thing one has to remember about it is that the whole country of Kenya was named after this mountain. There are 12 slowly melting glaciers on the mountain and 4 secondary peaks that are at the head of the glacial valleys. With its glacier peaks and forested slopes, Mount Kenya is one of the most stunning sceneries in East Africa." ],
